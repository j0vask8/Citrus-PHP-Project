It isn\'t open world (it features chapters with \'open\' areas you can roam round) and doesn\'t have nearly the same amount of content/side quests and the like, it\'s a more linear game - but it is fun for sure and the overall feel is similar, characterization is consistent, etc. TW2 has also aged well visually and still looks great, the combat doesn\'t feel awesome but neither does TW3\'s in my opinion (it is a weak point for the series).', 3, 'Y', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

It was a mess of a game even if the story is interesting enough - and it really, really, REALLY tested my patience. Chapter II in particular is a fucking slog, and what really sucks is it is the worst and the longest part of the game by a good amount.\r\n\r\nTW2 is definitely worth playing for those interested in it but I can\'t bring myself to recommend TW1 to anybody.

The dunwich borers part in fallout 4 was cool, too. I donâ€™t know why. Fallout 3 will always be my fav of the series though.
